# 🎙️ Sonic Space

**Talk. Earn. Own it.**  
Sonic Space lets you host live audio shows inside Farcaster, turn applause into crypto tips, and grow an audience you truly own.

---

## Tagline

**Where every voice is valued, and every moment is yours.**

---

## Oneliner

**Sonic Space is the live audio playground for Farcaster—where creators and communities connect, tip, and thrive in real time.**

---

## Vision

A world where **every voice is its own economy**. Sonic Space is building the sound layer for web-native communities: borderless, permissionless, and powered by the wallets we already carry.

---

## The Story

Creators have always owned the conversation—until the platform steps between and skims the value.  
Sonic Space makes the middleman vanish. Your voice goes straight to your community; their love flows straight to your wallet. No gatekeepers, no ads, no algorithm rolling the dice on your reach.

> “In my first Sonic Space I made more in 30 minutes than a month of ad revenue.” – **@0xPodcast**
