# 🎙️ Space

**Talk. Earn. Own it.**  
Space lets you host live audio shows inside Farcaster, turn applause into crypto tips, and grow an audience you actually control.

## The Story

Creators have always owned the conversation—until the platform steps between and skims the value.  
Space makes the middleman vanish. Your voice goes straight to your community; their love flows straight to your wallet. No gatekeepers, no ads, no algorithm rolling the dice on your reach.

> "In my first Space I made more in 30 minutes than a month of ad revenue." – **@0xPodcast**

## Motivation

Big platforms keep the profits and the people. Space flips the script by putting **wallet-to-wallet rewards** and **portable audiences** into the hands of every host.

4. Bigger supporters send direct tips without leaving the Frame.
5. You end the room—funds are already in your wallet.
